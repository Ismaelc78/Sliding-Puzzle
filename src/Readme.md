## Introduction

The content in this repo is for a school assignment on AI algorithms.
The purpose is to understand various algorithms including uninformed and informed (heuristic) methods.


## Problem Description 
For this assignment, the problem is that of a sliding-tile puzzle game.
This is a squared grid/board composed of n<sup>2</sup> tiles. The tiles contain numbers from 1 to (n<sup>2</sup> -1).
One tile is empty. The puzzle has a Goal state, which is the state we want to reach. This state could be one where 
all tiles on the board are in order, from left to right, top to bottom as seen in Figure 1. The puzzle starts with the 
board at the Start state, which is a state other than the Goal state as seen in Figure 1. We begin at the Start state
and aim to reach the Goal state by sliding the tiles around using the empty space.
